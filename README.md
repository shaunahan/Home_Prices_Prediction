# Home_Prices_Prediction

This repo contains a <ins> linear regression model </ins> using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Aim of the project is to predict the price of home in Bangalore city on the basis of past data. <br><br>
During model building, I used the concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, and k fold cross validation etc.
