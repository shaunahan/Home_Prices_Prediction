# Home_Prices_Prediction

This repo contains a model built using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com.
During model building, I used the concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
