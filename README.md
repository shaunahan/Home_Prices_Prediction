# Home_Prices_Prediction

This repo contains a <u> linear regression model </u> using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. </n>
During model building, I used the concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
