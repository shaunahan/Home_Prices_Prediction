# Home_Prices_Prediction

This repo contains a linear regression model using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Aim of the project is to predict the price of home in Bangalore city on the basis of past data. <br><br>
During model building, I used the concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc.
